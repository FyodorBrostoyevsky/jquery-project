In this project I will use Javascript and jQuery to build an in-browser sketchpad. By the end of this project I will have demonstrated a knowledge of jQuery methods and CSS.

In addition, it will allow me to develop more familiarity with Git as I'm sure I will oft break the tool and have to roll back my changes.
